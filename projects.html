Leveraging kids’ love for collecting things (stickers, baseball cards, shells, etc.), NatureCollections lets kids take pictures of nature, and curate their photos in categories such as plants, birds, and landscapes. In collaboration with the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, we ran multiple studies to see whether the app does indeed inrease childen's nature connection and enhance their experiences.

The module forms part of the <a class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-blue-gray" href="https://connectedlib.github.io">ConnectedLib Toolkit</a>, an open, online professional development toolkit designed to support librarians’ efforts to leverage new technologies and promote youth’s connected learning experiences. The civic engagement module was launched in February 2022, and is divided into four sections, which aim to (1) define civic engagement and its core attributes; (2) identify the library’s roles and assets for building powerful civic engagement services; (3) provide the tools to draw on connected learning principles to support civic engagement; and (4) outline tools, techniques and topics for sparking civic interest and civic engagement in libraries. The civic engagement module is intended to be used by librarians in both rural and urban settings. Working through the content and activities in the module, libraries will be able to identify the assets and opportunities within their communities to create impactful civic engagement programming based on their teen patrons’ interests, identities, and aspirations. <br><br> <a class="w3-text-blue w3-hover-text-blue-gray" href="https://youtu.be/Rsb1m5FymC4">Promoting Public Libraries as Centers of Youth Civic Engagement</a> Rotem Landesman, Chris Coward, &amp; Katie Davis (2022) CLS 2022: Connected Learning Summit </i></div>

      <div class="project_details">2021-present</div>
      <div class="project_blurb w3-text-grey"><i>This project aims to design,develop and test an intervention app, with the goal of helping teens to establish a sense of agency and intention over their social media use. Our goal is to support teens in feeling they’re in the driver’s seat of their social media experiences and through that improve their wellbeing. The developed app functions as a “wrapper” that allows researchers to control how teens enter the individual apps on their phone (e.g., Instagram, TikTok), as well as send reflective apps tied to the usage throughout the day. The intervention aims to break the cycle that many teens experience, whereby social media use they experience as unsatisfying contributes to lowered levels of wellbeing.
